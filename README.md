# About This Repository
This repository was created for Dev Together Madison's Github and Source Control basics workshop back in April 2019, designed around helping early-career devs be familiar with Git.

Since early-career devs are usually not familiar with Git, we'll be reusing this repository for future events that will involve Git. An example is for Oct 2019 event, we are having an Open Source night with an eye on Hacktoberfest https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/.

Should Mentees need some more familiarity with Git, this repository can be a good "first PR" practice for first-timers.

# Goal

This repo contains materials around very basic information around source control and Git and is meant to lay down the foundational knowledge to enable an early-career dev to understand the more advanced stuff later.

# Materials

## Presentation
Read through the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o78CV_huVXuK9IWuLFwoLwQeXjwNLf_wGkF5tnlgrRY/edit?usp=sharing) to get familiar with common source control and Git terminologies.

A [text version](./docs/source-control-basics/source-control-basics.md) of the presentation is also available.

## Exercises
The presentation above will reference exercises. See our exercises in our Issues section.
