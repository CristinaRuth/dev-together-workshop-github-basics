If it's your first time using github, nice to meet you!

I've learned how to use this open code platform today, 10.12.2019, and I noted all steps, because I don't want to forget that.

So, to help you understand a little and make your pull requests in a easier way, follow my list below:

1- You have to create an account in the github site
2- Search a repository to work on
3- Click in the repository and after, in the Fork button (This repository will appear in your github account)
4- In your github acount, with your new repository oppened, click on the green button said: Clone or Download
5- Copy that link and oppen your cmd (Command Prompt), there, you can put the commands to start you changes or challange

cmd:
1- Insert the words "git clone" and after, put the link of the repository (the one you coppied before) click "enter"
2- Posteriorly, edit the files you want in you computer and save that
3- After, back in cmd and digit: cd (and the name of the folder you clonned)
4- Digit "git status" (will show you the itens you modiffied or added in the file)
5- So type "git add ." 
6- Git commit -m "what you did" (this will place the modified file in the gihub repository, with the description you put)
7- And "git push" (will finish transmitting repository information to github)

Finally, go to the repository in your account and click the Pull Request button.
